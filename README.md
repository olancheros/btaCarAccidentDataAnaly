<h1>Bogota Automotor Accidents</h1>
<p>The objective of this exercise is to run an analysis about the automotor accidents in Bogota city since June 2015 till May 2022. The data used here comes from <a href="https://datosabiertos.bogota.gov.co/dataset/siniestros-viales-consolidados-bogota-d-c">Datos Abiertos Bogota</a>.</p>
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Get a bird's eye view of the data, checking the internal status of the csv (columns, null, mean, std)</li>
    <li>Visualization is used only for gaining knowledge, and methodological interpretations, such as improving the accuracy of Feature Engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>An analysis about car accidents in Bogota city during the last seven years has been done.</li>
    <li>Data shows that the biggest kind of car accident it's crash, followed by run over.</li>
    <li>In the majority of the cases, the final result of the car accident implies only material damages.</li>
    <li>The locality with highest rate of car accidents is Kenedy, followed by Engativa, and the locality with the lower car accidents inside the urban perimeter is La     Candelaria, however, the locality with lowest car accidents is Sumapaz.</li>
    <li>Analyzing the amount of accidents per month, the data shows that March it's the month with the highest car accidents over all the localities.</li>
    <li>2020 shows a reduction in car accidents, probably because of COVID-19 and the curfew. However, Kenedy's locality continues to be the area with the highest number of accidents.</li>
    <li>Looking at the geospatial map, we may see those car accidents resulting in dead people or hurt people occurring around the city, with a few small bright spots over specific zones.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Tasks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Try to find if there are clusters of car accidents around the city.</li>
    <li>Right now, the city it's having a lot of construction, so, the conditions are changing, but we can try to do some ML in order to predict and prevent the car       accidents around the city.</li>
    <li>Make more data analysis to understand the reasons why Kenedy is the locality with the highest rate of car accidents.</li>
</ul>
